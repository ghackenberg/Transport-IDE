# Publications

This page summarizes our publications on modeling, simulation, and optimization of transportation systems.
First, we provide a summary of workshops, conferences, and journals before providing links to our articles.

## Workshops, conferences, and journals

In the past, we contributed to the following workshops, conferences, and journals:

* [**MODELSWARD**<br/>International Conference on Model-Based Software and Systems Engineering](https://modelsward.scitevents.org/)
* [**ISDA**<br/>International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications](https://www.mirlabs.org/newsite/conferences.html)
* [**MT-ITS**<br/>International Conference on Models and Technologies for Intelligent Transportation Systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/1808904/all-proceedings)
