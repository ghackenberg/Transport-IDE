### 1. Feature Overview & Business Case (The "Why")

* **User Story / Epic:**
    * As a `[User Role]`, I want to `[achieve a goal with this feature]` so that `[I can get this benefit]`.

* **Business Value:**
    * Describe the value this feature brings to the business or the user.
    * (e.g., "This feature is expected to increase user engagement by 15%.", "It addresses the most common customer support request, reducing support ticket volume.", "It opens up a new revenue stream through premium subscriptions.")

* **Success Metrics:**
    * How will we measure the success of this feature after release?
    * (e.g., "Number of daily active users for this feature.", "Conversion rate from free to paid tier.", "Reduction in average task completion time.")

### 2. Functional Requirements & User Experience (The "What")

* **Core Functionality:**
    * A detailed, step-by-step description of how the feature works from the user's perspective. Use a list format for clarity.
    * 1. The user navigates to the 'Dashboard' screen.
    * 2. The user clicks the new 'Export Report' button.
    * 3. A dialog appears asking for the report format (PDF or CSV).
    * 4. Upon selection, the report is generated and downloaded.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * A checklist of specific, testable conditions that must be met.
    * - `[ ]` Given I am on the dashboard, the 'Export Report' button is visible.
    * - `[ ]` When I click the button, a format selection dialog appears.
    * - `[ ]` When I select 'PDF', a PDF file is correctly generated and downloaded.
    * - `[ ]` The generated report must contain columns A, B, and C.
    * - `[ ]` If the report generation fails, a user-friendly error message is displayed.

* **UI/UX Design:**
    * Link to or embed visual mockups, wireframes, and prototypes. Describe the user flow and any animations or interactions.
    * **Mockup:** ![UI Mockup](link-to-image.png)
    * **User Flow:** `Login -> Dashboard -> Click Export -> Select Format -> Download`
    * **Styling:** "Follow the existing application style guide. The new button should be a primary action button."

* **Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
    * What happens in non-ideal scenarios?
    * - What if the user has no data to export? (A message "No data available for export" should appear).
    * - What if the user loses internet connection during the export? (The process should be cancelled gracefully with a "Connection lost" message).

### 3. Technical Specification (The "How")

* **Affected Maven Modules:**
    * List the modules where changes will be made.
    * - `[ ]` `com.example.project:core-module` (for new business logic)
    * - `[ ]` `com.example.project:gui-module` (for new UI components and controllers)
    * - `[ ]` `com.example.project:api-module` (if new API endpoints are needed)

* **Proposed Implementation Plan:**
    * A high-level technical approach.
    * 1. Add a new service `ReportGenerationService` in the `core-module`.
    * 2. Create a new FXML view `ExportDialog.fxml` and its controller in the `gui-module`.
    * 3. Integrate the service with the `DashboardController`.

* **New Files / Components:**
    * - **Class:** `com.example.project.core.service.ReportGenerationService.java`
    * - **Class:** `com.example.project.gui.controller.ExportDialogController.java`
    * - **View:** `src/main/resources/com/example/project/gui/view/ExportDialog.fxml`
    * - **Test:** `com.example.project.core.service.ReportGenerationServiceTest.java`

* **Modified Files:**
    * - `com.example.project.gui.controller.DashboardController.java` (To handle the button click)
    * - `src/main/resources/com/example/project/gui/view/Dashboard.fxml` (To add the new button)

* **API Changes (if applicable):**
    * - **New Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/reports`
    * - **Request Body:** `{ "format": "pdf", "data": {...} }`
    * - **Response:** `200 OK` with the file stream.

* **New Dependencies:**
    * Specify any new third-party libraries needed.
    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.itextpdf</groupId>
        <artifactId>itext7-core</artifactId>
        <version>7.1.15</version>
    </dependency>
    ```

### 4. Data Model / Database

* **Database Schema Changes:**
    * Describe any new tables, columns, or indexes required.
    * - **New Table:** `REPORTS_LOG` (`id`, `user_id`, `report_type`, `created_at`)

* **Data Migration:**
    * Is any data migration needed? If so, describe the process.

---

### 5. Testing Strategy

* **Unit Tests:**
    * - Test the logic of `ReportGenerationService` for both PDF and CSV formats.
    * - Test the `ExportDialogController` logic.

* **Integration Tests:**
    * - Test the interaction between the `DashboardController` and the `ReportGenerationService`.

* **End-to-End (E2E) / Manual QA Plan:**
    * Provide a checklist for manual testing of the complete user flow.
    * 1. Log in as a standard user.
    * 2. Navigate to the dashboard.
    * 3. Click 'Export Report', select 'PDF', and verify the downloaded file's content and format.
    * 4. Repeat for 'CSV'.
    * 5. Test the "no data" edge case.
