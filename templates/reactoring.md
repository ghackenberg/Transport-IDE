# Refactoring Task: [Brief, Descriptive Title of Refactoring Goal]

**Date:** `YYYY-MM-DD`
**Author:** `[Your Name]`
**Ticket/Issue:** `[Link to Jira, Trello, or other tracking tool]`

---

### 1. Goal & Motivation (The "Why")

* **Primary Objective:**
    * Clearly state the main goal. (e.g., "Improve performance of the `OrderProcessingService` by 20%," "Reduce technical debt in the `reporting` module to improve maintainability," "Decouple the UI from the business logic to allow for easier UI updates.")

* **Problem Statement / Technical Debt:**
    * Describe the specific issues with the current codebase. What "code smells" are present?
    * (e.g., "The `UserDataManager` class violates the Single Responsibility Principle, handling database access, validation, and API serialization.", "There is significant duplicated code across `ProductViewController` and `CategoryViewController`.", "The current implementation relies on a deprecated library that poses a security risk.")

* **Expected Outcome & Business Value:**
    * What are the measurable benefits of this refactoring?
    * (e.g., "Faster page loads for users," "Reduced time for future feature development in this module," "Elimination of a class of bugs related to inconsistent state management," "Improved system stability.")

---

### 2. Scope & Boundaries

* **In-Scope Modules/Components:**
    * List the specific Maven modules, packages, or classes that are the focus of this refactoring.
    * - `[ ]` `com.example.project:core-module`
    * - `[ ]` `com.example.project:gui-module`

* **Out-of-Scope:**
    * Explicitly state what should *not* be changed. This is critical to prevent scope creep.
    * (e.g., "The public API of the `core-module` must remain unchanged.", "This task does not include updating the user interface visuals.", "Database schema modifications are out of scope.")

---

### 3. Current State Analysis (The "Before")

* **Current Architecture/Design:**
    * Briefly describe the existing design.
    * Include a simple diagram (UML, block diagram) if it helps clarify the current state.
    * *Example Diagram:*
        ```
        [Controller] -> [FatServiceClass] <-> [DAO]
        ```

* **Identified Issues (Code Smells):**
    * - **Long Methods:** `LegacyService.processEverything()`
    * - **Large Classes:** `UserDataManager`
    * - **Inappropriate Intimacy:** Classes in `module-a` directly accessing implementation details of `module-b`.
    * - **High Coupling / Low Cohesion:** ...

* **Relevant Metrics (Optional but Recommended):**
    * **Cyclomatic Complexity:** `[Class#method]` has a complexity of `[value]`.
    * **Code Coverage:** The `[class]` has `[value]%` test coverage.
    * **Performance Benchmark:** The `[operation]` currently takes `[value]` ms to complete.

### 4. Proposed Refactoring (The "After")

* **Target Architecture/Design:**
    * Describe the new design that will be implemented.
    * Provide a diagram illustrating the target state.
    * *Example Target Diagram:*
        ```
        [Controller] -> [OrchestratorService] -> [ValidationService]
                                              -> [PersistenceService] -> [DAO]
        ```

* **Specific Refactoring Steps:**
    * List the key refactoring techniques to be applied.
    * - `[ ]` **Extract Class:** Create `ValidationService` and `PersistenceService` from `FatServiceClass`.
    * - `[ ]` **Introduce Parameter Object:** Consolidate the 5 parameters of the `calculate()` method into a `CalculationParameters` object.
    * - `[ ]` **Replace Inheritance with Composition:** The `SpecialButton` class will no longer extend `BaseButton` but will contain an instance of it.
    * - `[ ]` **Rename/Move Files:**
        * **Rename:** `FatServiceClass.java` -> `OrderOrchestrator.java`
        * **Move:** `com.example.utils.StringUtils` -> `com.example.core.util.StringUtils`

### 5. Impact & Risk Analysis

* **Dependency Impact:**
    * Which other parts of the system will be affected by these changes and need to be updated? (e.g., "All controllers that currently inject `FatServiceClass` will need to be updated.")

* **Performance Considerations:**
    * Will this change affect performance? Is benchmarking required before and after?

* **Risks:**
    * - **Regression:** High risk of breaking existing functionality in the payment processing flow.
    * - **Effort:** The scope is large and might take longer than estimated.

---

### 6. Testing & Verification Strategy

* **Goal:** Ensure that no existing functionality is broken (i.e., no regressions are introduced).

* **Prerequisites:**
    * `[ ]` Ensure the existing code has adequate test coverage before starting. If not, a separate task should be created to add tests first.

* **Testing Steps:**
    * `[ ]` Run all existing unit and integration tests for the affected modules. They must all pass before and after the changes.
    * `[ ]` Write new unit tests for any new classes or logic introduced.
    * `[ ]` Perform manual regression testing on the following user flows:
        * 1. User login and authentication.
        * 2. Creating a new order.

* **Verification of Success:**
    * How will we know the refactoring was successful?
    * `[ ]` All tests pass.
    * `[ ]` Code review approved.
    * `[ ]` **Metrics Improved:**
        * Cyclomatic complexity of `[Class#method]` is reduced from `[old_value]` to `[new_value]`.
        * Performance of `[operation]` improved from `[old_value]` to `[new_value]`.

### 7. Definition of Done

* `[ ]` The code has been refactored according to the proposed design.
* `[ ]` No regressions have been introduced; all existing functionality is verified.
* `[ ]` All existing and new tests pass.
* `[ ]` The application builds successfully with `mvn clean install`.
* `[ ]` Code is documented and follows project coding standards.
* `[ ]` The changes have been peer-reviewed and approved.
* `[ ]` The feature branch has been merged into the target branch (e.g., `develop`).
