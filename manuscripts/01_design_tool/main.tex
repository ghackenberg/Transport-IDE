	\section{Introduction}
	\label{sec:introduction}
	
	The transformative patterns of future mobility are enabled by interconnected as well as integrated systems and services.
	For this, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) establish new transportation paradigms such as connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) \cite{kopelias2020connected}, multi-modal and demand-responsive transport systems \cite{brake2004demand}, as well as the transportation electrification by sustainable operation of electric vehicles \cite{zhang2020role}. In order to minimize environmental impacts, complex scenarios between these systems and their requirements need to be holistically addressed, from which integrated system designs are derived, which enable transportation infrastructure and heterogenous actor efficiency and sustainability.
	
	%Therefore, constituent systems need to be designed with respect to most efficient structures and control strategies within themselves, while accounting for and exploiting the emergent properties they achieve in conjunction and interdependence with other systems, as composed, integrated system-of-systems (SoS). 
	
	To systematically support the aforementioned systems engineering task, model- and simulation-based systems engineering~\cite{gianni2014modeling} can be employed for abstraction of design problems through the formulation of system models and their evaluation in terms of concrete behavior at run time, where simulation aids projecting run-time information and performance metrics about the system under design and environment. 
	%For this, well-defined system models are formulated at design time, where simulation aids projecting run-time information and performance metrics about the system under design and environment. 
However, as systems and their underlying requirements are typically imperfectly understood at the beginning of the design task, methods and tools are needed to explore the possible design space for emerging transportation paradigms, which support evaluation of system design alternatives and verification of system properties. 
	
	%As an effect of underspecified requirements, system models are often not completely understood, and modeling uncertainties need be adressed. 
	
	%Both structural as well as behavioral system design tasks can be supported using an overarching system design methodology at design time as well as at run time. 
	%In terms of benefits, on the one hand side, system models faciliate gaining improved system understanding through specification, while allowing rapid system modification through defined variation points for designing a system. On the other hand side, simulation aids approximating information about the system dynamics and performance of a system under design.
	
	% omitted
	%For this, in previous work, we established an integrated systems modeling technique for integrated transportation and power systems, which allows one to model both transportation and power system scenarios, as well as mobility-on-demand scenarios to assess system design options systematically, while improving system understanding holistically, based on a formal foundation~\cite{ascher_hackenberg_2015,ascher_hackenberg_2016,ascher_hackenberg_2017}. The formal foundation was extended by a discrete event formalism \cite{ascher2023discrete} as well as integration with external transport simulation tools and predictive models for control strategy optimization \cite{ascher_hackenberg_albayrak_2023}.
	
	%\paragraph{Research objectives.}
	
	With our research, we want to help improve the efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability of today's transportation systems.
	To achieve this goal, we work on methodologies for designing such systems and verifying their properties.
	Fundamentally, we promote a formal approach capturing the relevant design decisions and their relations.
	Furthermore, we integrate scenario-based simulation of system dynamics and evaluation of emergent properties.
	Finally, we exploit optimization algorithms for optimizing system dynamics as well as static design decisions.
	
	%\paragraph{Research questions.}
	
	In this paper, we explore how the next generation of design tools for ITS addressing emerging paradigms could look like.
	Therefore, first we want to understand which system properties and design decisions should be represented in these tools.
	Then, we want to learn how design decisions could be verified with respect to the desired system properties.
	Finally, we want to study how the relevant design information could be represented in a graphical user interface.
	
	%\paragraph{Research methodology.}
	
	In the following, we first describe an overview of related work for our approach in Section~\ref{sec:related-work}. Then, we describe approach and methodology for a model- and simulation-based systems engineering framework for capturing and evaluating design decisions in Section~\ref{sec:approach}.
	Thereafter, we describe a tool prototype for building system designs, conducting simulation runs, and visualizing simulation outcomes in Section~\ref{sec:tool-prototype}.
	%We propose two specific applications of our framework as well as user interface technology.
	%Finally, we draw our conclusions and describe future direction of research and development on the design of ITS in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.

%For this, real-time and historical traffic information for routing and operation strategies to avoid congestions can be considered \cite{Boriboonsomsin2012}.

	Our model- and simulation-based systems engineering approach is based on \cite{ascher_hackenberg_2015,ascher_hackenberg_2016,ascher_hackenberg_2017,ascher_hackenberg_albayrak_2023,ascher2023discrete}
	and employs an integrated systems modeling technique for design of integrated ITS systems and investigation of emergent system properties. Our modeling technique supports both static property, i.e. structural and infrastructure design, and dynamic property design, i.e. behavior and control strategy design. Here, Figure \ref{fig:concept} shows an overview of the system design methodology.

	%\subsection{Design methodology}
	%\label{sec:methodology}

	%Our approach employs model- and simulation-based systems engineering~\cite{gianni2014modeling} for decision-making with respect to system designs for the ITS domain.
	%Models are described based on the problem domain, where simulation aids obtaining information about designs of the solution domain. 
	%For the latter, we employ a scenario-based approach, where a set of requirements is typically mapped from and to scenarios \cite{sutcliffe_supporting_1998}. 
	%Figure \ref{fig:concept} shows an overview of the system design methodology.
	
	% TODO Figure
	%\begin{figure}[!ht]
	%	\centering
	%	\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{property_optimization.png}
	%	\caption{System design methodology}
	%	\label{fig:concept}
	%\end{figure}
	
%	\subsubsection{Problem Formulation}
%	For system models, each concept is described in terms of their static (i.e.\ time-independent) properties and calculations as well as their dynamic (i.e.\ time-dependent) properties concerning state evolution during simulation including states and actions. In addition, we describe requirements of a system design in terms of contribution functions as well as constraint functions, which are mapped to static or dynamic properties.
%	
%	In terms of static properties, we define a one-tuple $(COM)$ consisting of the components, as well as their parameters and configurations, which we describe subsequently:
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item Component. The core element of the underlying systems modeling technique is the \textit{component}, where components are denoted by $com \in COM$. 
%		\item Parameters. Parameters describe static information about components which does not change based on dynamic behavior, i.e. time steps.
%		\item Configurations. Components are configured with respect to specific sets of parameters by using within \textit{configurations} $\mathcal{COM}_{conf}: COM$. Here, a configuration refers to a specific set of \textit{parameters}. For example, a configuration for a component $com_{id}$ containing a single parameter $com_{param} \in \mathbb{D}$, with arbitrary domain $\mathbb{D}$, could be defined as a mapping $\mathcal{COM}_{conf}: COM \rightarrow \mathbb{D}$.
%		
%	\end{itemize}
%	
%	For dynamic properties, we define the four-tuple $(S, A, T, E)$, consisting of the sets of states $S$, actions $A$, transition functions $T$ and events $E$, which we describe subsequently:	
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item State variables $S_t$ constitute the states at time $t$ within a state space of all possible states $S$ such that $S_t \subset S$. Here, the state variables describe a vector of system or observable environment variables at a given time instant. 
%		\item Action variables $a_t$ describe the actions available to choose from at time $t$ within a discrete action space $A$ such that $a_t \subset A$. Actions $a_t$ depend on the state variables $S_t$ as indexed by time $t$.
%		\item Transition functions $T$ describe how one state $S_t$ at time $t$ evolves to another state $S_{t+1}$ at time $t+1$, given an action $a_t$. Transition functions describe a mapping such that $T : S \times A \to S$. 
%		\item Events $E$ are defined as functions over a system's trajectory of states, which indicate when actions need to be taken in the system simulation. They describe a mapping $E : S \to A$. 
%	\end{itemize}
%	
%	The parameters and actions \textit{which} need to be taken are determined based on a set of requirements, where we define objectives as contribution functions, as well as constraint functions. Thus, we define the tuple $(C, CSF)$, which is subsequently described:
%	
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item Contribution functions $C$ describe a numerical value for being in a state $S_{t}$ while taking action $a_{t}$ in a particular time instant $t$. Here, a contribution function is a mapping $C : S \times A \to \mathbb{R}_0$.
%		\item Constraint functions $CSF$ describe mappings such that $CSF : S \times A \to \mathbb{B}$ with Boolean set $\mathbb{B} = \{\mathit{true},\mathit{false}\}$, and therefore restrict admissable, i.e. valid, states and actions. 
%	\end{itemize}

%	\subsubsection{Application to Design Problems}
%	Based on the described concepts, our approach supports different design tasks, where evaluation of designs is performed using approximate and heuristic optimization techniques. We utilize optimization to evaluate solutions for the following design problems:
%
%	\begin{enumerate}
%		\item \textbf{Static property optimization} concerns static design decisions such as optimization of transportation infrastructure properties. For this, the methodology assumes a \textit{configuration space}, which describes components, their parameters, as well as connection possibilities between components. From the configuration space, components are instantiated using concrete parameters, which are determined based on requirements, i.e. objectives and constraints, thereby creating a structure. The outcome of static property  optimization describes a system model configuration.
%		\item \textbf{Dynamic property optimization} concerns dynamic design decisions, i.e. optimization of control strategies such as determining efficient transportation entity behavior. This task involves exploring the state space of a system model configuration based on a set of requirements, where the outcome is a control strategy. Here, control strategy engineering involves determining trajectories of states and actions which conform to imposed requirements, i.e. goals and constraints. 
%		\item \textbf{Mixed property optimization} concerns the integrated design task for optimization of both static and dynamic design decisions. Thus it describes the integrated task which involves both static and dynamic property optimization.
%	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsection{System theory}
	\label{sec:domain-specific-modeling}
	
	%Figure~\ref{fig:modeling-technique} provides an overview of main domain concepts, where the formalism is intended to capture a concise and an essential set of static properties, static calculations, and dynamic states as well as events for establishing sound models and control strategies for on-demand transportation systems. For details on the underlying modeling concepts, we refer to \cite{ascher2023discrete}. Subsequently, we describe a brief overview of these concepts.
	
	The approach allows domain-specific modeling of integrated transportation system problems on mesoscopic to microscopic levels.
	Figure \ref{fig:domain-specific-modeling} depicts domain-specific modeling concepts. Subsequently, we provide a brief overview of domain concepts, states, as well as events, where we refer to \cite{ascher2023discrete} for a detailed overview.

		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.42\columnwidth]{../../events/demand.png}
		\caption{Domain-specific modeling concepts.}
		\label{fig:domain-specific-modeling}
	\end{figure}
	
	\paragraph{Concepts}
	
	The formalism defines intersections $i \in I$, segments $s \in S$ as well as locations $l \in L$ for describing properties about the transportation infrastructure.
	Based on the transportation infrastructure, we use charging stations $cs \in CS$ for describing the charging infrastructure. Furthermore, we use vehicles $v \in V$ to describe the transportation supply and capacities. Transportation demands $d \in D$ are based on the transportation infrastructure, and temporarily consume transportation capacities such as vehicles.
	
	\paragraph{States}
	Based on the concepts, we describe dynamic (i.e. time-dependent) state functions for charging stations $S_{CS}$, demands $S_{D}$, as well as vehicles $S_V$:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item In terms of charging station states $S_{CS}$, we describe the current vehicle which is connected to the charging station $S_{CS.CV}$, as well as the current charge speed $S_{CS.CCS}$.
		\item In terms of demand states $S_{D}$, we describe the current vehicle carrying the demand $S_{D.CV}$, as well as the current location of the demand $S_{D.CL}$.
		\item For vehicle states $S_{DV}$, we describe the current battery level of the vehicle $S_{V.CBL}$, the current location of the vehicle $S_{V.CL}$, as well as the current drive speed of the vehicle $S_{V.CDS}$.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\paragraph{Events}
	We define the following domain-specific events $E$:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Events indicating vehicle arrival at intersections $E_{V.AI}$ or vehicle departure at intersections $E_{V.DI}$ to derive routing decisions. 
		\item Events indicating vehicle arrival at charging stations $E_{V.ACS}$ to derive charging decisions. 
		\item Events indicating vehicle arrival at demand pick-up locations $E_{V.ADP}$ and at drop-off locations $E_{V.ADD}$ to derive pick-up and drop-off decisions. 
		\item Events indicating faster vehicle arrival at slower vehicles $E_{V.AVS}$, as well as faster vehicle departure at slower vehicles $E_{V.DVS}$ to derive overtaking decisions on the same segment.
		\item Events indicating demand appearance $E_{D.AD}$ to derive decisions for vehicles to serve demands.
		\item Events indicating vehicle drive speed change $E_{V.CDS}$ and charge speed change $E_{V.CCS}$ to derive decisions for overtaking and charging behaviors. 
		\item Events indicating vehicle batteries becoming empty $E_{V.CBE}$ or full $E_{V.CBF}$ to derive decisions for stopping driving and charging behaviors.
	\end{itemize}

\subsection{Problem Solution}
\label{sec:problem-solution}
%The design problem consists in determining the set of states and actions which conform to the imposed objectives and constraints. 

For solving according design problems, Dynamic Programming (DP) \cite{bellman_dynamic_1957} methods can be employed for small-scale problems by iteratively exploring the state space over a defined time horizon to find an optimal solution,
but are subject to increasing problem complexity with increasing dimensionality of parameter, state and action spaces, i.e. the curse of dimensionality \cite{bellman_dynamic_1957}, restricting their applicability.
%Due to expontially increasing problem complexity and limited computational resources, 
To reduce simulation and decision making complexity, we apply the following methods:
\paragraph{Monte-Carlo Simulation} methods are used, which partially and/or randomly \textit{sample} the state space until an sufficient number of samples is reached for exploration to limit problem complexity \cite{ascher_hackenberg_2015}. 
\paragraph{Discrete-Event Simulation} is used, where events are defined as functions over a system's trajectory of states, which indicate \textit{when} actions need to be taken in the system simulation, thereby reducing action space dimensionality ~\cite{ascher2023discrete}.
	%Thus, simulation complexity is reduced by limiting action space dimensionality and by abstracting from discrete-time resolutions~\cite{ascher2023discrete}.
%As noted, a policy function $\pi$ may be a simple function or may involve extensive computation as a search process \cite{mania2018simple}. To reduce policy function computation complexity 
\paragraph{Heuristic Search} procedures are employed, which are iteratively designed by domain experts, where simulation results are utilized to adapt heuristic control logic as needed \cite{ascher_hackenberg_2015}.
	% Approximate Dynamic Programming
\paragraph{Approximate Dynamic Programming} methods employ approximations of policy and value functions \cite{powell_approximate_2007}, which are used to reduce DP problem complexity \cite{ascher_hackenberg_albayrak_2023}.

	\section{Tool prototype}
	\label{sec:tool-prototype}
	
	Based on the general approach explained in Section~\ref{sec:approach} we started developing an open source tool prototype hosted on GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/ghackenberg/transport-ide}}, which we subsequently describe:
	%The tool prototype is written in Java\footnote{\url{https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/}} and uses the Swing library\footnote{\url{https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/}} as well as the JFreeChart library\footnote{\url{https://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/}} for visualization.
	%Furthermore, the prototype uses the JGraphT\footnote{\url{https://jgrapht.org/}} library for computing shortest paths in the road network.
	%In the following, we explain several aspects of the tool prototype:
	In Section~\ref{sec:data-model} we describe core data structures for representing both static system configurations and dynamic system states.
	Then, in Section~\ref{sec:controller-interface} we explain how users can implement and integrate different control strategies into the tool prototype.
	Next, in Section~\ref{sec:statistics-interface} we describe data collected during simulation runs which can be used for visualizations and possibly training.
	In Section~\ref{sec:simulation-engine} we provide an overview of the engine, which computes discrete events and updates system states accordingly.
	Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:application} we highlight two different framework applications.
	
	%Figure~\ref{fig:software-architecture} illustrates the module architecture of the tool prototype.
	%The architecture consists of the eight modules \texttt{model}, \texttt{controller}, \texttt{statistics}, and \texttt{simulator} as well as \texttt{parser}, \texttt{exporter}, \texttt{viewer}, and \texttt{program}.

	%    \caption{Modular software architecture.}
	%    \label{fig:software-architecture}
	%\end{figure}
	
	%In the following, we discuss each module in more detail including their resposibilities and dependencies on the other modules.
	
	\subsection{Data structures}
	\label{sec:data-model}
	
	The \texttt{model} module provides the core data structures for modeling static system configurations and representing dynamic system states.
	Figure~\ref{fig:data-model} shows the classes, their attributes, and their relationships.
	
	\begin{figure}[!ht]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=0.30]{../../diagrams/model/classes-v0.2.png}
		\caption{Configuration and simulation data model.}
		\label{fig:data-model}
	\end{figure}
	
	The \texttt{Intersection} class represents intersections of the driving infrastructure.
	Each intersection stores its coordinate in three-dimensional space.
	Note that we use Cartesian coordinates for simplicity.
	
	The \texttt{Segment} class represents road segments of the driving infrastructure.
	Each segment points to its source and target intersection and provides a method for computing its length based on Euclidean distance.
	%Note that we use the Euclidean distance between source and target intersection here.
	
	The \texttt{Location} class represents specific points on the segments of the driving infrastructure, where
	each location points to a corresponding segment.
	Furthermore, each location stores a distance on this segment measured in Eclidean units of the Cartesian space.
	
	The \texttt{ChargingStation} class represents the charging infrastructure.
	Each charging station stores its location on the driving infrastructure.
	Furthermore, each charging station optionally points to a current vehicle.
	Each charging station provides the current charging speed, where the simulator computes the current charging speed dynamically.
	
	The \texttt{Vehicle} class represents the driving resources.
	Each vehicle provides an initial and a current location on the driving infrastructure.
	The initial location defines the position of the vehicle in the initial state of the simulation.
	Then, the simulator continuously updates the current location of the vehicle.
	Furthermore, each vehicle stores a length and a capacity, a maximum, an initial, and a current battery level, and a current drive speed.
	The length determines how much space the vehicle occupies on the driving infrastructure.
	The capacity defines how much demand the vehicle can carry.
	The maximum battery level specifies the size of the energy storage.
	The initial battery level stores the load state of the enery storage at simulation start.
	Finally, the simulator continuously updates current battery level and current drive speed.
	
	The \texttt{Demand} class represents the transportation loads to be served.
	Each demand points to a pickup and a dropoff location as well as a current location and vehicle.
	Furthermore, each demand stores a size as well as an appear, and earliest pickup, and a latest dropoff time.
	The simulator continuously updates the current location and vehicle.
	
	\subsection{Control strategies}
	\label{sec:controller-interface}
	
	%For evaluation of defined system designs, the approach offers an controller interface for defining control strategies. 
	
	During a simulation run, a number of control decisions have to be taken.
	For example, when arriving at an intersection each vehicle has to select the next outgoing road segment.
	Similarly, when arriving at a demand pickup location each vehicle as to decide whether to serve the demand or not.
	The overall system performance heavily depends on the optimality of the individual choices made during a simulation run.
	Therefore, one key engineering task for this class of systems is to develop an appropriate control strategy.
	Since desired control strategies cannot be hardcoded upfront, the simulator supports plugging in and testing different strategies, which must implement the controller interface methods depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:controller-interface}.

		\caption{Methods of the controller interface.}
		\label{fig:controller-interface}
	\end{figure}
	
	%For tool demonstration and evaluation purposes
	We currently provide four different implementations of the controller interface: A \textbf{manual}, a \textbf{random}, a \textbf{greedy}, and a \textbf{smart} control strategy.
	Figure~\ref{fig:control-strategies} provides an overview of the four control strategies and their decision logic.
	Columns of the matrix represent individual control strategies, rows represent decisions to be taken, and cells represent corresponding logic.
	
	\begin{figure}[!ht]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.65\columnwidth]{control_strategy_overview.png}
		\caption{Overview of the control strategies.}
		\label{fig:control-strategies}
	\end{figure}
	
	In the following, we describe the logics behind each of the control strategies in more detail.
	
	\subsubsection*{Manual control strategy}
	\label{sec:controller-manual}
	
	The manual control strategy delegates routing, demand pickup, and charge decisions to the tool user using input dialogs.
	The remaining control decisions are derived automatically.
	
	Figure~\ref{fig:manual-controller-route} shows the input dialog for route decisions, which pops upon vehicle arrival at an intersection.
	It provides the vehicle name (\texttt{V} in the example) and possible follow-up road segments (\texttt{C->D} and \texttt{C->E} in the example).
	Note that \texttt{C}, \texttt{D}, and \texttt{E} represent the intersection names connected through segments.
	The user can select the desired routing option by pressing the button for the respective follow-up segment.
	
	\begin{figure}[!ht]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{../../screenshots/manual-controller-route.png}
		\caption{Vehicle route choice.}
		\label{fig:manual-controller-route}
	\end{figure}
	
	Figure~\ref{fig:manual-controller-demand} shows the input dialog for demand pickup decisions, which pops up when a vehicle arrives at the pickup location of an appeared and unserved demand. It provides the vehicle name (\texttt{U} in the example), demand data (i.e.\ pickup location, earliest pickup time, dropoff location as well as latest dropoff time), and two choice buttons (i.e.\ yes and no).
	
	\begin{figure}[!ht]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{../../screenshots/manual-controller-demand.png}
		\caption{Demand pickup choice.}
		\label{fig:manual-controller-demand}
	\end{figure}
	
	Figure~\ref{fig:manual-controller-charge} shows the input dialog for vehicle charging decisions, which pops up when a vehicle arrives at the location of an unoccupied charging station.
	The dialog provides the name of the vehicle (\texttt{U} in the example), the location of the charging station (\texttt{A->B:50} in the example), and the buttons for the two available choices (i.e.\ yes and no).
	\begin{figure}[!ht]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{../../screenshots/manual-controller-charge.png}
		\caption{Vehicle charging choice.}
		\label{fig:manual-controller-charge}
	\end{figure}
	Finally, the strategy always selects the maximum driving speed for each vehicle without considering possible collisions and always chooses to fully charge vehicle batteries after the user decided to start the charging process.
	
	\subsubsection*{Random control strategy}
	\label{sec:controller-random}
	
	The random control strategy uses a random number generator for making routing, demand pickup, and charging decisions.
	For each decision, it assigns equal probabilities to available choices (i.e.\ outgoing segments of intersections or yes and no).
	Driving speed and target battery charge level are handled equally to the manual control strategy.
	
	\subsubsection*{Greedy control strategy}
	\label{sec:controller-greedy}
	
	The greedy control strategy 
	%uses a more sophisticated logic for determining 
	determines routing decisions upon vehicle arrival at intersections of the driving infrastructure.
	Its logic comprises four rules being sequentially processed until one rule applies:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item When the battery of the vehicle is only half full or less, the strategy randomly selects an outgoing road segment with charging station if such segment is available.
		\item Then, when the vehicle carries one or more demands, the strategy randomly selects the drop-off segment of one such demand if reachable directly via the intersection.
		\item Next, when the vehicle carries no demand, the strategy randomly selects the pick-up segment of an unserved demand if reachable directly via the intersection.
		\item Finaly, when none of the above three rules apply, the strategy randomly selects any of the outgoing road segments of the current intersection with uniform probability distribution.
	\end{enumerate}
	Note that the desribed routing logic only considers the next segment and does not perform a look-ahead across more segments.
	Finally, the greedy control strategy always chooses to pick up demands or charge vehicle batteries if arriving at an unserved demand pick-up location or charging station.
	The strategy always chooses to drive at maximum speed and fully charge batteries if a charging process has started.
	
	\subsubsection*{Smart control strategy}
	\label{sec:controller-smart}
	The smart control strategy uses a more sophisticated strategy for determining routing decisions upon vehicle intersection arrivals.
	Its logic comprises four rules being sequentially processed until one rule applies:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item When the vehicle carries one or more demands and a charging station can be reached via their drop-off location, the segment leading to the closest such demand is selected.
		\item When the vehicle carries no demands and a charging station can be reached via the pick-up location of an unserved demand, the segment leading to the closest such demand is selected.
		\item When the vehicle carries no demands and does not plan to pick-up a new demand, the segment leading to the closest charging station is selected if reachable with the remaining battery level.
		\item Finally, when none of the above three rules apply, again the strategy randomly selects any of the outgoing road segments of the current intersection with uniform probability distribution.
	\end{enumerate}
	When arriving at an unused charging station, this strategy only starts charging if no other charging station can be reached with the current battery level.
	When the charging station is occupied, but no other charging station can be reached, the strategy lets the vehicle wait at the station to become free.
	With this strategy vehicles always pick up unassigned demands when passing by, charge their batteries fully when at charging stations, and drive with maximum speed.
	
	\subsection{Data recorder}
	\label{sec:statistics-interface}
	
	During simulation, a number of events are recorded for visualization of system (and control strategy) performance as well as strategy training.
	Figure~\ref{fig:statistics-interface} shows the provided methods of the data recorder interface.
	
	\begin{figure}[!ht]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{../../diagrams/statistics/classes-v2.png}
		\caption{Data recorder interface.}
		\label{fig:statistics-interface}
	\end{figure}
	
	The recorder tracks, when a vehicle crosses an intersection, and records associated routing decisions of the control strategy.
	It tracks, when a vehicle passes by an unassigned demand and the control strategy declines or accepts the pick up.
	Similarly, the recorder tracks, when a vehicle drops off a demand at its target location.
	Furthermore, it continuously tracks the speed and overall travel distance of vehicles and size of time steps made during discrete event simulation.
	
	Currently, we use data about intersection crossing for determining driving infrastructure bottlenecks and data about pick ups and drop offs for determining per demand waiting and driving time as well as delays.
	%In the future, we plan to add more recording capabilities as well as exploring additional use cases for the data.
	
	\subsection{Simulation engine}
	\label{sec:simulation-engine}

%	\begin{figure}[!ht]
%		\missingfigure{Simulation loop}
%		\caption{Simulation loop}
%	\end{figure}
	
	The simulation engine computes event times, delegates control decisions to the control strategy, updates model state, and dispatches relevant data to the recorder.
	It employs a simulation loop, which advances the model time and updates the model state until no more events are to be processed.
	The simulation loop can be divided into three main steps:
	
	\paragraph{Step 1}
	
	%\textcolor{red}{TODO}
	Make routing decisions and update vehicle locations.
	Make charging decisions and update connections between vehicles and charging stations.
	Make pick up decisions, perform drop offs (also if vehicle battery empty), and update connections between vehicles and demands.
	Make speed decisions and update vehicle speeds.
	
	\paragraph{Step 2}
	
	%\textcolor{red}{TODO}
	Compute time of next event to be processed:
	Determine speed update timeout,
	charging speed update or charging station disconnect timeout,
	intersection arrival,
	charging station arrival,
	vehicle battery empty/full,
	demand appearance,
	demand overdue,
	demand pick up / drop off location arrival, and
	vehicle attach / detach.
	
	\paragraph{Step 3}
	
	%\textcolor{red}{TODO}
	Based on current time and time until next event do the following:
	Update vehicle locations, vehicle battery levels, and record travelled distances of vehicles.
	Detect vehicle collisions based on their location, width, and overlaps along the segment line.
	Finally, set model time to time of next event.
	
	\subsection{Specific applications}
	\label{sec:application}
	
	Based on the previous components we implemented two specific applications:
	The first application can be used for comparing the performance of different control strategies (see Section~\ref{sec:controller-comparison}).
	The second application can be used for comparing the performance of different driving and charging infrastructures as well as fleet configurations (see Section~\ref{sec:infrastructure-comparison}).

%	\subsubsection{Control strategy evaluation}
%	\label{sec:controller-evaluation}
%
%	\textcolor{red}{TODO}
	
	\subsubsection{Control strategy comparison}
	\label{sec:controller-comparison}
	
	To compare different control strategies, we apply them to the same system configuration (including driving / charging infrastructure as well as fleet setup) and scenario (i.e.\ demand profile).
	For performance evaluation, we measure the times between demand appearances at the pick up location and subsequent disappearances at the drop off location.
	Figure~\ref{fig:controller-comparison} shows an example system configuration, where random, greedy, and smart control strategies are applied.
	\begin{figure}[!ht]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.85\columnwidth]{controller_comparison.png}
		\caption{Control strategy comparison.}
		\label{fig:controller-comparison}
	\end{figure}
	The upper part of the window shows for each control strategy the current system state including the vehicle locations and the active demands.
	The lower part of the window shows for each control strategy the total times that have passed between demand appearances and their respective disappearances.
	From the diagram we can deduct that in this simulation run the smart control strategy showed superior performance over the others.
	Note that due to strategy randomness, the result might differ in a proceeding run.
	
	\subsubsection{System configuration comparison}
	\label{sec:infrastructure-comparison}
	
	To compare system configurations, we instead apply the same control strategy and scenario (i.e.\ demand profile) to different versions of the driving / charging infrastructure as well as fleet setup.
	Note that differing infrastructure versions might include additional road segments not present in others and thus require that demands only reference road segments, which are included in every version.
	Figure~\ref{fig:infratructure-comparison} shows an example of such system configuration comparison.
	\begin{figure}[!ht]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.85\columnwidth]{infrastructure_comparison.png}
		\caption{System configuration comparison.}
		\label{fig:infratructure-comparison}
	\end{figure}
	Again, the upper window part shows for each control strategy the current system state including vehicle locations and demands.
	The lower window part shows the total times between demand appearance and disappearance for each system configuration.
	In this simulation run, the configuration in the middle, which adds only one additional road segment, has the best performance.
	The example demonstrates that the smart control strategy may not always deliver optimal results, which is necessary for fair comparison of infrastructures.
	
	\section{Conclusion}
	\label{sec:conclusion}
	
In this work, we described a design tool for a model- and simulation-based systems engineering framework for capturing design decisions and evaluating static and dynamic properties for ITS design. In addition to capturing different design decisions, users can guide design decisions by systematic comparison and evaluation of system configuration and control strategies. Application results demonstrate the feasibility of the design tool for verification of ITS design decisions with respect to static and dynamic system properties.
