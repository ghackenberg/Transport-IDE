	The interconnection between intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and services poses fundamental challenges with respect to establishing most efficient structures, infrastructures, as well as intelligent and integrated control strategies addressing new transportation paradigms such as autonomous vehicles, demand-responsive transport as well as the transportation electrification. Systematic methods for efficiently modeling, simulating and evaluating these systems are required, which are able to address aforementioned challenges.
	For this, we present a formalization of essential static properties, dynamic state functions, as well as events concisely describing transportation system design space in the scope of emerging transportation paradigms. Our proposed formalization allows for reduction of simulation complexity by focusing on relevant events impacting the design problem at hand only, while omitting unimportant details negatively impacting simulation performance, thereby reducing both modeling as well as simulation effort. In addition, the provided formalization of system theory and discrete events serves as an interface for deriving well-defined system structure as well as efficient control strategies.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Meeting sustainability goals and reducing carbon emissions \cite{sachs2019six} is a driving factor of the transformation of transportation systems towards their more efficient operation.
In this, new and connected transportation paradigms such as autonomous vehicles, demand-responsive transport \cite{brake_demand_2004} as well as the transportation electrification \cite{pereirinha2018main} provide fundamental and, more significantly, conjoined drivers towards intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and services.
However, the interconnection between intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and services poses fundamental challenges, in particular with respect to establishing most efficient structures, infrastructures, as well as intelligent and integrated control strategies.
Quality assurance of these systems and services is a critical challenge as constituting systems and services form integrated system-of-systems with heterogeneous system requirements, goals, constraints and stakeholders, which need to be systematically addressed by integrated system design and control strategies.
Therefore, systematic development methods for these challenges as well as these emerging domain paradigms are required.

\subsection{Related work}

To describe, evaluate and compare integrated transportation system design options systematically, we previously introduced an approach for modeling integrated intelligent transportation system properties which addresses scenarios such as vehicle-to-grid (V2G) interactions on both transportation and power systems \cite{Ascher2015}, \cite{Ascher2016} and electrified autonomous mobility-on-demand systems \cite{Ascher2017}.
As simulation complexity increases with the number and dimensionality of states and actions of the modeled systems as well as decreasing sizes of fixed time discretization steps, our approach was limited to microscopic design problems with impeded simulation accuracy, where for instance detection of collision events between traffic participants was dependent on sufficiently small-time discretization and sampling steps.

Discrete-event simulation (DES) represents an approach which significantly reduces simulation complexity by limiting number and dimensionality of actions, while abstracting from discrete-time resolutions.
In recent years, DES has seen increased research attention in both transportation \cite{clemente2013discrete, fanti2017fleet} and power \cite{lebeau2013implementing, ferro2019predictive, lopez2021modeling} domains.
For instance, Clemente et al.~\cite{clemente2013discrete} propose a discrete event simulation approach in the context of car sharing, where a fleet of vehicles is shared and utilized, i.e. driven and parked, by customers.
However, compared to our scope, they do not model the interactions arising from autonomous electric vehicles in the scope of mobility-on-demand systems, such as demand responsive transport and interactions with a charging infrastructure.
Lopez et al.~\cite{lopez2021modeling} model electric vehicle charging and derived hourly and weekly electricity demands using a DES-based model.
They focus on modeling at home charging behavior of electric vehicles of private users, compared to our scope, which instead focuses on modeling both transportation and charging demands of fleets of shared autonomous electric vehicles.
Finally, Li et al.~\cite{li2021simulation} model electric car sharing systems using a discrete-event simulation based approach. For this, they consider infrastructures such as charging stations and links, as well as electric vehicles and transport demands in their proposed model.

\subsection{Problem statement}

Current approaches for modeling, simulating and evaluating transportation system designs are not able to holistically address integrated system challenges.
On the one hand side, transportation infrastructures and control algorithms need to be holistically evaluated, based on the heterogeneous systems they are composed of and the heterogeneous requirements they have to adhere to.
On the other hand side, simulation complexity of integrated systems rises according to model complexity, such as employed discretization of time resolution, as well as number and dimensionality of system states and actions.
While the approach of discrete event simulation is able to address latter problems, current modeling approaches for system design do not offer appropriate domain abstractions in terms of their provided structural and behavioral modeling capabilities to describe these systems on a required level of detail.
In addition, the approaches do not offer support for evaluating heterogeneous application scenarios in terms of their configuration space for new transportation paradigms.
Therefore, we consider it important to assess the following research question: Which set of essential system properties, dynamic state functions as well as events are necessary and relevant for describing integrated system problems in the context of emerging transportation paradigms such as autonomous vehicles, demand-responsive transport and the transportation electrification?

\subsection{Contribution}

To address this situation, in this work, we provide a description and formalization of a concise and essential set of static system properties, dynamic state functions as well as discrete events, which help reduce simulation complexity significantly. 
This is achieved by focusing on relevant events impacting the design problem at hand only, thereby reducing modeling effort and omitting unimportant details negatively impacting simulation performance, while providing a well-defined notation and interface for deriving sound system design structure and efficient control strategies. In summary, we provide the following contributions:

In Section~\ref{sec:theory} we provide a formalization of the underlying system theory of our approach, which focuses on definition of a concise and essential set of static properties and dynamic states for establishing models of transportation systems in the context of autonomous vehicles, demand responsive transport and the transportation electrification.
Then, in Section~\ref{sec:events}, based on introduced system theory, we provide a formalization of discrete events for determining decisions that must be considered for high-performance state computation, where event-based formalization supports abstraction and complexity reduction of system simulation, and can be utilized for deriving well-defined and efficient control strategies. 
Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:con}, we conclude with a short discussion of our approach as well as its application for deriving system designs and control strategies, and provide an outlook on future work.

\section{System theory}
\label{sec:theory}

In the following, we explain the underlying system theory, which is based on our approach for integrated transportation system design (see~\cite{Ascher2014,Ascher2015,Ascher2016,Ascher2017}).
We extend and improve upon this approach in this work, where the system theory presented in this work is intended to capture a concise and an essential set of static properties, static calculations, and dynamic states for establishing sound models and control strategies for transportation systems.
These static properties, static calculations, and dynamic states serve as a foundation for further abstraction and reduction of system simulation complexity using discrete events, for which we refer to Section~\ref{sec:events}.

Figure~\ref{fig:concepts} provides an overview of the proposed discrete event formalism.
We use intersections $i \in I$, segments $s \in S$ as well as locations $l \in L$ for describing properties about the transportation infrastructure.
Based on the transportation infrastructure, we use charging stations $cs \in CS$ for describing the charging infrastructure.
In addition, we describe transportation demands $d \in D$ on the transportation infrastructure. 
Finally, we use vehicles $v \in V$ for describing transportation supply and capacities.
In the following, we describe each concept in more detail including their static (i.e.\ time-independent) properties and calculations as well as their dynamic (i.e.\ time-dependent) state functions typically sampled during computer simulations.
We describe intersections, segments and locations in Section \ref{sec:intersections-segments}, and charging stations, demands as well as vehicles in Section \ref{sec:chargingstations-demands-vehicles}.

\subsection{Intersections, segments and locations}
\label{sec:intersections-segments}

In this Section, we describe intersections and segments of the transportation infrastructure as well as locations. These concepts are visualized in Figure \ref{fig:intersections-segments}.

\end{figure}

%\vspace{2mm}
\noindent \textbf{Intersections} (see Figure \ref{fig:intersection}) define the routing points of the transportation infrastructure.
Each intersection must have a coordinate in the corresponding reference coordinate system such as the three-dimensional Euclidean space.
Mathematically, \textit{intersections} can be described as elements $i \in I$ with the following static property functions $P_{I}$:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $P_{I.C}: I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$ represents the coordinate $c = P_{I.C}(i)$ of the intersection $i$ in coordinate system units.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Segments} (see Figure \ref{fig:segment}) define the straight roads of the transportation infrastructure.
Each segment must define a source and a target intersection, which represent the start and the end coordinates of the straight road.
The length of the segment can be computed from the coordinates of the source and the target intersection.
Additionally, each segment must define a width and a maximum drive speed.
Mathematically, \textit{segments} can be described as elements $s = (i_s, i_t) \in I \times I = S$ with source intersection $i_s \in I$ and target intersection $i_t \in I$, such that the source intersection $i_s$ is not equal to the target intersection $i_t$, i.e.\ $i_s \neq i_t$.
Then, we define the following static calculation functions $C_{S}$:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $C_{S.L}: S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_0^+$ represents the length $l = P_{S.L}(s)$ of segment $s$ in coordinate system units, such that the length $l$ equals to the Euclidean distance between the coordinate $c_s = P_{I.C}(i_s)$ of source intersection $i_s = P_{S.SI}(s)$ and coordinate $c_t = P_{I.C}(i_t)$ of target intersection $i_t = P_{S.TI}(s)$, i.e.\ $l = |c_t - c_s|$.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Locations} (see Figure~\ref{fig:location}) define charging station, demand, and vehicle positions on the transportation infrastructure.
Each location must define a segment and a travelled distance on that segment.
Mathematically, \textit{locations} can be described as elements $l = (s, d) \in S \times \mathbb{R}_0^+ = L$ with segment $s$ and distance $d$ in coordinate system units, such that the distance $d$ is less than or equal to the length $l = C_{S.L}(s)$ of segment $s$, i.e.\ $d \leq l$.

\begin{itemize}
	\item $P_{CS.L}: CS \rightarrow L$ represents the location $l = P_{CS.L}(cs)$ of charging station $cs$.
\end{itemize}
For charging stations, computer simulations typically sample the following dynamic state functions $S_{CS}$:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $S_{CS.CV}: CS \times \mathbb{T} \rightarrow V \cup \{\perp\}$ represents the current vehicle $v = S_{CS.CV}(cs, t)$ connected to charging station $cs$ and time $t$, and

\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Demands} (see Figure \ref{fig:demand}) define the transportation loads that temporarily consume the available transportation capacities.
Mathematically, \textit{demands} can be described as elements $d \in D$ with the following static property functions $P_{D}$:

	\item $P_{D.PL}: D \rightarrow L$ represents the pick-up location $pl = P_{D.PL}(d)$ of demand $d$, and
	\item $P_{D.DL}: D \rightarrow L$ represents the drop-off location $dl = P_{D.DL}(d)$ of demand $d$, such that the drop-off location $dl$ is not equal to the pick-up location $pl$, i.e.\ $dl \neq pl$.
\end{itemize}
For demands, computer simulations typically sample the following dynamic state functions $S_{D}$:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $S_{D.CV}: D \times \mathbb{T} \rightarrow V \cup \{\perp\}$ represents the current vehicle $v = S_{D.CV}(d, t)$ carrying demand $d$ at time $t$, and
	\item $S_{D.CL}: D \times \mathbb{T} \rightarrow L$ represents the current location $cl = S_{D.CL}(d, t)$ of demand $d$ at time $t$.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Vehicles} (see Figure \ref{fig:vehicle})  define the transportation capacities available on the transportation infrastructure.
Mathematically, \textit{vehicles} can be described as elements $v \in V$ with the following static property functions $P_{V}$:

\end{itemize}

\section{Discrete events}
\label{sec:events}

Based on the system theory from Section~\ref{sec:theory} we introduce our discrete event formalism including location events (see Section~\ref{sec:location-events}), demand events (see Section~\ref{sec:demand-events}), speed events (see Section~\ref{sec:speed-events}) and battery events (see Section~\ref{sec:battery-events}).

\subsection{Location events}
\label{sec:location-events}

Location events trigger when the current vehicle locations satisfy certain conditions and comprise vehicle-intersection location events (see Section~\ref{sec:intersection-location-event}), vehicle-charging station location events (see Section~\ref{sec:charging-station-location-events}), vehicle-demand location events (see Section~\ref{sec:demand-location-events}), as well as vehicle-vehicle location events (see Section~\ref{sec:vehicle-location-events}).

\subsubsection{Vehicle-intersection location events}
\label{sec:intersection-location-event}

Vehicle-intersection location events occur, when vehicles arrive or depart at intersections (see Figure \ref{fig:routing-events}).
These events have been included in the formalism, because vehicles need to make routing decisions when arriving at intersections.

\end{figure}

%\vspace{2mm}
\noindent \textbf{Vehicle arrives at intersection} (see Figure \ref{fig:vehicle-at-intersection-before}) occurs at time $t \in \mathbb{T}$ if and only if there exists a vehicle $v \in V$ and a location $(s,d) \in L$ with segment $s \in S$ and traveled distance $d \in \mathbb{R}_0^+$ such that the vehicle $v$ at time $t$ is at location $(s,d)$, i.e. $S_{V.CL}(v,t) = (s,d)$, and the traveled distance $d$ on segment $s$ equals the length of the segment $s$, i.e. $P_{S.L}(s) = d$.

\vspace{2mm}
\noindent \textbf{Vehicle departs at intersection} (see Figure \ref{fig:vehicle-at-intersection-after}) occurs at time $t \in \mathbb{T}$ if and only if there exists a vehicle $v \in V$ and a location $(s,d) \in L$ with segment $s \in S$ and traveled distance $d \in \mathbb{R}_0^+$ such that the vehicle $v$ at time $t$ is at location $(s,d)$, i.e. $S_{V.CL}(v,t) = (s,d)$, and the traveled distance $d$ on segment $s$ is zero, i.e. $d = 0$.

\vspace{2mm}
\noindent \textit{Note that each vehicle arrives at intersection event occurs concurrently with a follow-up vehicle departs at intersection event.}

\subsection{Vehicle-charging station location events}
\label{sec:charging-station-location-events}

Vehicle-charging station events occur, when vehicles arrive at charging stations.
These events have been included in the formalism, because vehicles need to make charging decisions when arriving at charging stations. 

\vspace{2mm}
\noindent \textbf{Vehicle arrives at charging station} occurs at time $t \in \mathbb{T}$ if and only if there exists a vehicle $v \in V$ and a charging station $cs \in CS$ with location $l = P_{CS.L}(cs)$, such that the vehicle $v$ at time $t$ is at location $l$, i.e. $S_{V.CL}(v, t) = l$, and for all previous times $t' \in \mathbb{T}$ with $t' < t$ where vehicle $v$ was at location $l$, i.e. $S_{V.CL}(v, t') = l$, there exists an intermediate time $t'' \in \mathbb{T}$ with $t' < t'' < t$, such that vehicle $v$ was not at location $l$, i.e. $S_{V.CL}(v, t'') \neq l$.

\subsubsection{Vehicle-demand location events}
\label{sec:demand-location-events}

Vehicle-demand location events occur, when vehicles arrive at demand pick-up and drop-off locations (see Figure~\ref{fig:demand-events}).
These events have been included in the formalism, because vehicles need to make demand pick-up decisions and perform drop-offs.

\subsubsection{Vehicle-vehicle location events}
\label{sec:vehicle-location-events}

Vehicle-vehicle location events occur, when a vehicle starts and finishes overtaking another vehicle (see Figure~\ref{fig:overtaking-events}).
These events have been included in the formalism, because there needs to be enough space for vehicles overtaking each other.

\subsection{Demand events}
\label{sec:demand-events}

Demand events occur, when the information about demands appear in the computer simulation.
This event has been included in the formalism, because when information about demands appear the vehicles can change their behavior.

\noindent \textbf{Demand appears} occurs at time $t \in \mathbb{T}$ if and only if there exists a vehicle $v \in V$ and a demand $d \in D$, such that the demand $d$ at time $t$ doesn't have an assigned current vehicle $v$, i.e. $S_{D.CV}(d, t) = \{\perp\}$, and such that the demands appear time $P_{D.AT}$ equals the current time $t$, i.e. $P_{D.AT} = t$.

\subsection{Speed events}
\label{sec:speed-events}

Speed events occur, when vehicles change their driving and charging speeds.
These events have been included in the formalism, because drive speeds influence overtaking behaviors and charging speeds influence electric loads.

\vspace{2mm}
\noindent \textbf{Vehicle drive speed changes} occurs at time $t \in \mathbb{T}$ if and only if there exists a vehicle $v \in V$ with current drive speed $S_{V.CDS}(v, t)$, such that for all previous times $t' \in \mathbb{T}$ with $t' < t$, where the current drive speed $S_{V.CDS}(v,t')$ of vehicle $v$ at time $t'$ was identical, i.e. $S_{V.CDS}(v,t') = S_{V.CDS}(v,t)$, there exists an intermediate time $t'' \in \mathbb{T}$ with $t' < t'' < t$, such that the current drive speed $S_{V.CDS}(v,t'')$ of vehicle $v$ at time $t''$ is different, i.e. $S_{V.CDS}(v,t'') \neq S_{V.CDS}(v,t)$.

\vspace{2mm}
\noindent \textbf{Vehicle charge speed changes} occurs at time $t \in \mathbb{T}$ if and only if there exists a vehicle $v \in V$ with current charge speed $S_{V.CCS}(v, t)$, such that for all previous times $t' \in \mathbb{T}$ with $t' < t$, where the current charge speed $S_{V.CCS}(v,t')$ of vehicle $v$ at time $t'$ was identical, i.e. $S_{V.CCS}(v,t') = S_{V.CCS}(v,t)$, there exists an intermediate time $t'' \in \mathbb{T}$ with $t' < t'' < t$, such that the current charge speed $S_{V.CCS}(v,t'')$ of vehicle $v$ at time $t''$ is different, i.e. $S_{V.CCS}(v,t'') \neq S_{V.CCS}(v,t)$.


\subsection{Battery events}
\label{sec:battery-events}

Battery events occur, when the vehicle batteries are either empty or full.
These events have been included in the formalism, because when empty vehicles stop driving and when full vehicles stop charging.

\vspace{2mm}
\noindent \textbf{Vehicle battery becomes empty} occurs at time $t \in \mathbb{T}$ if and only if there exists a vehicle $v \in V$ such that the current battery level of vehicle $v$ at time $t$ is zero, i.e. $S_{V.CBL}(v,t) = 0$ and for all previous times $t' \in \mathbb{T}$ with $t' < t$, where the current battery level of vehicle $v$ was zero, i.e. $S_{V.CBL}(v,t') = 0$, there exists an intermediate time $t'' \in \mathbb{T}$ with $t' < t'' < t$, such that the current battery level of vehicle $v$ was not zero, i.e. $S_{V.CBL}(v,t'') \neq 0$.

\vspace{2mm}
\noindent \textbf{Vehicle battery becomes full} occurs at time $t \in \mathbb{T}$ if and only if there exists a vehicle $v \in V$ such that the current battery level of vehicle $v$ at time $t$ equals the maximum battery level of vehicle $v$, i.e. $S_{V.CBL}(v,t) = P_{V.MBL}(v)$, and for all previous times $t' \in \mathbb{T}$ with $t' < t$, where the current battery level of vehicle $v$ equals the maximum battery level of vehicle $v$, i.e. $S_{V.CBL}(v,t') = P_{V.MBL}(v)$, there exists an intermediate time $t'' \in \mathbb{T}$ with $t' < t'' < t$, such that the current battery level of vehicle $v$ does not equal the maximum battery level of vehicle $v$, i.e. $S_{V.CBL}(v,t'') \neq P_{V.MBL}(v)$.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:con}

In this work, we presented a discrete event formalism for fast simulation of on-demand transportation systems.
The approach works well, when cars are assumed to drive with constant speed most of the time because states can be omitted.
This assumption obviously limits the validity of the model, because in reality car speeds are never constant.
However, we believe that this simplification provides sufficient validity for use cases such as transportation system and control strategy design.
