# `Swing` module

This software package supports several use cases from basic simulation to controller and infrastructure comparison.
In the following, we provide brief descriptions and screenshots of the individual use cases.

## `BasicSimulation` program

Basic simulation allows one to evaluate system performance for a given controller algorithm and transportation infrastructure.
