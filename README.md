# transport-ide

Transport IDE provides a tool for transportation system designers to analyse requirements (e.g. travel time, energy consumption) as well as to derive, verify, and validate concepts (e.g. transportation infrastructure, control strategy).

## Screenshots

This software package supports several use cases from basic simulation to controller and infrastructure comparison.
In the following, we provide brief descriptions and screenshots of the individual use cases.

### Basic simulation

Basic simulation allows one to evaluate system performance for a given controller algorithm and transportation infrastructure.

### Controller comparison

Controller comparison allows one to evaluate system performance for a set of controller algorithms and a given transportation infrastructure.

### Infrastructure comparison

Infrastructure comparison allows one to evaluate system performance for a given controller algorithmn and a set of transportation infrastructures.
