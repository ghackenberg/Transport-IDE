# Transport-IDE

![](./images/social_preview.png)

The goal of **TransportIDE** is to make the life of *transportation infrastructure* and *control strategy engineers* easier.
We believe that this engineering domain needs new tools and methodologies to develop better systems with higher performance in shorter time and at lower lifetime cost.
In particular, we think that transportation system engineers must be supported better in

1. analyzing requirements for specific application scenarios (e.g. travel time and energy consumption) as well as
2. deriving, verifying, and validating principle solution variants (including transportation, charge, and maintenance infrastructure as well as control strategy).

**TransportIDE** is an *open source software project* initiated by Dr. Georg Hackenberg, Professor for Industrial Informatics, School of Engineering, [University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria](https://fh-ooe.at/) and Dominik Ascher, Research Associate, Distributed Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, [Technical University of Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/).

## Repository structure

This is how we structured the Transport-IDE repository:

* 📁 [**Documents**](./documents/)<br/>Contains the user and developer docs.
* 📁 [**Images**](./images/)<br/>Contains image materal used, e.g., in the docs.
* 📁 [**Manuscripts**](./manuscripts/)<br/>Contains articles written in Latex.
* 📁 [**Models**](./models/)<br/>Contains sample system models.
* 📁 [**Modules**](./modules/)<br/>Contains the actual source code.
* 📁 [**Prototypes**](./prototypes/)<br/>Contains random prototypes.
