# Transport-IDE

![](./images/social_preview.png)

The goal of **Transport-IDE** is to make the life of *transportation infrastructure* and *control strategy engineers* easier.
We believe that this engineering domain needs new tools and methodologies to develop better systems with higher performance in shorter time and at lower lifetime cost.
In particular, we think that transportation system engineers must be supported better in

1. analyzing requirements for specific application scenarios (e.g. travel time and energy consumption) as well as
2. deriving, verifying, and validating principle solution variants (including transportation, charge, and maintenance infrastructure as well as control strategy).

**Transport-IDE** is an *open source software project* initiated by Dr. Georg Hackenberg, Professor for Industrial Informatics, School of Engineering, [University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria](https://fh-ooe.at/) and Dominik Ascher, Research Associate, Distributed Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, [Technical University of Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/).

## Features

Here is a list of currently supported features of Transport-IDE:

- ‚≠ê *System modeling*
  - **Driving infrastructure** through *intersections* and *segments*
  - **Charging infrastructure** through *stations*
  - **Fleet configurations** through *vehicles*
  - **Load scenarios** through *demands*
- ‚≠ê *Control strategies*
  - **Random strategy** throwing the dice for every decision
  - **Manual strategy** asking the user for every choice to be made
  - **Greedy strategy** behaving randomly unless demand can be dropped
  - **Smart strategy** based on shortest path algorithm
- ‚≠ê *Scenario simulations*
  - **Discrete-event semantics** for minimal computational effort
  - **Monte-Carlo experiments** for statistical behavior analysis
  - **Multi-threaded executions** for maximum computation speeds

Feel free to request new features via GitHub issues!

## Requirements

To build and run the project you need to following software packages:

- [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/)<br/>provides a **Java compiler and runtime environment**
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)<br/>provides a **dependency management and build configuration tool**

To work on the code you can use the following software package:

- [Eclipse IDE for Java Developers](https://www.eclipse.org/)<br/>provides an **integrated development environment**

## Modules

This software packages comprises three modules and their dependencies.
The following diagram provides an overview of the software modules included.
Technically, the software modules are implemented as Java Jigsaw and Apache Maven modules.
