# Project: Transport IDE

## Introduction

This project, 'Transport IDE', is a comprehensive Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed for simulating and analyzing transportation systems. It provides tools for defining transportation networks, simulating vehicle movements, and analyzing various performance metrics.

## Key Modules

The project is structured into several key modules:

- **core**: Contains the fundamental logic and data structures for transportation simulation.
- **cli**: Provides a command-line interface for interacting with the simulation engine.
- **fx**: Implements a graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX for visualizing simulations and managing models.
- **swing**: Implements a graphical user interface (GUI) using Swing for visualizing simulations and managing models.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Transport IDE, please refer to the `README.md` file in the project root directory for build instructions and initial setup. Detailed documentation for each module can be found in their respective `src/main` directories.
